        <h1>Benefits of GYM</h1>
        <article>
        <ol>
            <h3><li>Exercise can make you feel happier</li></h3>
            <p>
                Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help maintain weight loss. When you engage in physical activity, you burn 
                calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you burn.
                Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't worry if you can't find a large chunk of time to exercise every day. Any amount of activity 
                is better than none at all. To reap the benefits of exercise, just get more active throughout your day — take the stairs instead of the 
                elevator or rev up your household chores. Consistency is key.

            <p>
                     the effect of exercise on weight reduction, it is important to understand the relationship between 
                     exercise and energy expenditure (spending).
                     Your body spends energy in three ways: 
              <ol type="i">
                <li>digest food</li>
                <li>exercising</li>
                <li>maintaining body functions, like your heartbeat And breathing</li>
              </ol>
                    maintaining body functions, like your heartbeat and breathing
                    While dieting, a reduced calorie intake will lower your metabolic rate, which can
                   temporarily delay weight loss. On the contrary, regular exercise has been shown to increase your metabolic rate, which can 
                   burn more calories to help you lose weight (Trusted Source6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).
                   Additionally, studies have shown that combining aerobic exercise with resistance
                   training can maximize fat loss and muscle mass maintenance, which is essential for keeping 
                   the weight off and maintaining lean muscle mass (9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source).

            <h3><li>Exercise is good for your muscles and bones
            </li></h3>
            <p>
                Exercise plays a vital role in building and maintaining strong muscles and bones.
                Activities like weightlifting can stimulate muscle building when paired with adequate protein intake. 
                This is because exercise helps release hormones that promote your muscles’ ability to absorb amino acids. This helps them grow 
                and reduces their breakdown (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).
                As people age, they tend to lose muscle mass and function, which can lead to an increased risk of injury. Practicing regular 
                physical activity is essential to reducing muscle loss and maintaining strength as you age (14Trusted Source).

                18Trusted Source).
                One older study found that 6 weeks of regular exercise reduced feelings of fatigue for 36 people who had reported persistent 
                fatigue (19).
                Exercise can also significantly increase energy levels for people with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and other health conditions 
                (20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).
                In fact, exercise seems to be more effective at combating CFS than other treatments, including passive therapies like relaxation 
                and stretching or no treatment at all (20Trusted Source).
                And let’s not forget the fantastic heart and lung health benefits of exercise. Aerobic exercise boosts the cardiovascular system 
                and improves lung health, which can significantly help with energy levels. 
                Exercise can be a real energy booster for many people, including those with various medical conditions (17Trusted Source,
