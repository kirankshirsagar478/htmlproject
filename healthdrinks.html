            <h3><li>Drinking Clean Water</li></h3>
            <p>
                Water is essential for your body. It prevents dehydration, constipation, and kidney stones. 
                Plus, with no calories, it’s the best beverage for your waistline. If you add 1 to 3 cups of
                fewer calories per day. Too plain? Calorie-free flavor drops sweeten, but may have artificial
                flavors, colors, or preservatives. Try a squeeze of citrus instead.
            </p>

            <h3><li>Best Choice: Filtered Coffee</li></h3>
                <p>
                    againCoffee has gotten a bad rap before, but studies show it may protect st type 2 diabetes
                    , liver disease, and lower your odds of heart disease. Three to five cups a day seems to 
                    be healthy, as long as you go easy on the cream and sugar. But if you’re pregnant or
                    brew yours with a paper filter. It gets rid of a substance called cafestol that 
                    can raise LDL cholesterol.
                </p>
               
                It can also help improve cognitive function and helps lower the risk of death from all causes.

            <h3><li>Best Choice: Tea</li></h3>
            <p>
                Green, black, and other kinds are full of antioxidants, which may protect you against some 
                types of cancer, stroke, heart disease, and high blood pressure. Plus, unsweetened brews are
                at home -- without the added sugars that bottled tea can have.                 
            </p>
            <img src="media/hd3.jpg" alt="error" height="400">
            <h3><li>Good Choice: Milk </li></h3>
            <p>
                It’s a powerhouse of nutrients like calcium, vitamin D, and potassium, which keep your muscles
                , teeth, and bones healthy. And a cup of it has more protein than a large egg. To get more 
                nutrition from fewer calories, look for low-fat and skim options. Some nondairy milks -- soy
                , oat, almond, and others -- have some of the same nutrients as cow’s milk, but the 
                concentration of these is low per serving.

            <h3><li>Green Tea</li></h3>
            <p>
                Green tea has been hailed for its health benefits in Asian countries for centuries
                only recently did Americans get the memo. While many know green tea as a healthy drink
                that hydrates and soothes the soul, this drink does even more good than you may know.
                types of cancer like breast cancer and prostate cancer. Studies suggest it can also help 
                reduce sharp increases in blood sugar after a meal, which can be especially beneficial for
                people with type 2 diabetes. Give this warm and soothing lemon thyme green tea a try.

            <h3><li>Pomegranate Juice</li></h3>
            <p>

                All-natural pomegranate juice is one of the most nutritious beverages on supermarket shelves.
                decrease inflammation, which may help relieve some types of arthritis. It’s also rich in 
                immune-boosting vitamin C, making it one of our favorite healthy drinks to fight off colds.

            <h3><li>Beet Juice</li></h3>
            <p>

                Need a few reasons why you should incorporate beets into your diet? Beets’ health
                , magnesium and nitrates. Our bodies convert nitrates into nitric oxide, which helps lower
                blood pressure and improve blood flow. Some studies suggest it’s a great food to eat before
                you workout to increase stamina. Grab a juicer and make this sweet healthy drink to go.

            <h3><li>Lemon Water</li></h3>
            <p>

                We recommend starting your day with lemon water. Lemon water is a surprisingly powerful 
                immune booster. Just 2 tablespoons of lemon juice stirred into a glass of water adds 14mg
                it tastes better—one more way to help stay hydrated.

            <h3><li>Kombucha</li></h3>
            <p>

                What is kombucha, anyway? This elixir is one of the hottest healthy drinks on the market. 
                Wellness junkies rave about kombucha’s health benefits. Like other healthy fermented foods
                , fizzy kombucha is packed with probiotics that promote healthy bacteria in the gut. 
                These bacteria aid in digestion and help your body absorb vitamins and minerals.

            <h3><li>Coconut Water </li></h3>
            <p>

                
                The flavor of this tropical water is a bit controversial. Some people love it, and some hate
                a surprising amount of potassium. Potassium plays an important role in maintaining a healthy
                heartbeat and regulating blood pressure. If you like carbonation, try this sparkling 
                coconut water. (It’s one of our favorite healthy carbonated drinks.)

            <h3><li>Hot Chocolate</li></h3>
            <p>
                Who knew treats could be nutritious? We’ve all heard about the health benefits of cacao, but this antioxidant-rich 
                drink is even more beneficial when mixed with milk, which is high in calcium and usually fortified with vitamin D. Find 
                a new favorite hot chocolate recipe or try one of our favorite hot chocolate brands.
            </p>

            <h3><li>Cranberry Juice</li></h3>
            <p>
                This tangy juice is packed with antioxidants that can help prevent cardiovascular disease and some types of cancer, and 
                promotes a healthy urinary tract. Cranberry juice is tart on its own, so it’s combined with sugar or other, sweeter fruit 
                juices. Look for varieties that are 100% juice so you’re taking in all of cranberries’ health benefits.
            </p>

            <h3><li>Red Wine</li></h3>
            <p>
                Thought red wine was only good for kicking back and relaxing? Think again. Studies suggest that moderate amounts of any 
                alcohol can help increase HDL (good cholesterol) and prevent artery damage. Resveratrol is an antioxidant specifically 
                found in red wine that might have even more health benefits like helping to decrease LDL (bad cholesterol) and prevent 
                blood clots. Red wine may even improve your oral health, too! Try a glass a day or switch things up with a warming glass 
                of mulled red wine.

            <h3><li>Orange Juice</li></h3>
            <p>
                Possibly the most ubiquitous juice on the market, fresh orange juice is one of the healthiest drinks you can grab. 
                Everybody knows it’s a great source of vitamin C, but most people don’t know that this healthy drink is a good source 
                of potassium and thiamin plus calcium and vitamin D if it’s fortified. If you find fizz refreshing, try it in an orange 
                juice spritzer.
